  <PES_watchtower.label>WatchTower</PES_watchtower.label>
  <PES_watchtower.description>Modern construction technology made it possible to build a watch tower much taller than a primitive one. Besides the height, some modern electronic devices can make the colonist on sentry duty see further. Can work without electricity, but only provide half the vision range and detection range.</PES_watchtower.description>
  <PES_watchtower.comps.4.name>Mini Nutrient Paste Dispenser</PES_watchtower.comps.4.name>
  <PES_watchtower.comps.4.description>Install a nutrient paste dispenser inside the tower, so that the sentinel colonist does not need to leave the watchtower occasionally for food. Accept Raw food inside.</PES_watchtower.comps.4.description>
  <PES_watchtower.comps.5.name>Radio</PES_watchtower.comps.5.name>
  <PES_watchtower.comps.5.description>Install a radio inside the watchtower, so that the sentinel colonist can listen to it while being on sentry duty. Keep the sentinel's recreational need at a moderate level</PES_watchtower.comps.5.description>
  <PES_watchtower.comps.6.name>Searchlight</PES_watchtower.comps.6.name>
  <PES_watchtower.comps.6.description>With a search light, the watchtower can be used with 60% efficiency when it's dark at the cost of extra 500W power consumption.</PES_watchtower.comps.6.description>
  <PES_watchtower.comps.7.name>Tactical Telescope</PES_watchtower.comps.7.name>
  <PES_watchtower.comps.7.description>With a telescope installed, the sentinel can see even further on the tower.\n+50% Vision Range\n+50% Detection Range</PES_watchtower.comps.7.description>
